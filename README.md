# ConnectionLibrary

- This repository is a Web API that has CRUD operations (Create - Post, Read - Get, Update - Put, Delete - Delete) on objects that I store into a SQL database.
- If you would like this to work on your machine, simply change the connection string in the appsettings.json file.
- Video explaining the code can be found on my YouTube channel here: https://youtu.be/84Phgt1zTHg?si=yAzuPzH2OQMVJTub
